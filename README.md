Repository including Juptyer Notebook and Presentation File for 'Automated “Wheel” Options Momentum Strategy Using MACD'

- This strategy looks to capitalize on a basic options 'wheel' strategy which is a rotation of selling covered puts to enter a position, then selling covered calls on that aquired position to collect premium. This strategy takes the 'wheel' strategy one step further by entering positions and closing positions in a 'wheel' fashion by utilizing MACD indicators.
