Repository including Juptyer Notebook and Presentation File for 'Automated “Wheel” Options Momentum Strategy Using MACD'

- This strategy looks to capitalize on a basic options 'wheel' strategy which is a rotation of selling covered puts to enter a position, then selling covered calls on that aquired position to collect premium. If the position is exercised, one would hope to sell covered puts to re-enter this position and collect additional premium. Our strategy takes the 'wheel' strategy one step further by entering positions and closing positions through this 'wheel' fashion by utilizing quantitative MACD momentum signals.
